    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # This action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
      # so your workflow can access it.

      # Step 4: Verify kubectl context (optional but recommended)
      # This step helps confirm that kubectl is configured correctly and
      # can connect to your cluster.

      # found in the 'Kubernetes/' directory.
